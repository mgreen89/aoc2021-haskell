# Haskell Advent of Code 2021

Advent of Code 2021 solutions in Haskell.

## Acknowlegdement

Most of the code here was very heavily based on https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-dev.

I've ignored anything I didn't understand (for now), so this has less functionality, but enough for me to be happy using it this year (2021).

## To-do

- Support GHC 9.2 and `OverloadedRecordDot` to clean up all the record prefixes
- Understand lenses better
- Understand TemplateHaskell enough to use it to generate the base list of all solutions
- Add test data/answer parsing
- Add functionality to pass test-specific paramaters to solution functions.
